Implementation:
Milestone Three - Build VRF Oracle and Graph API Oracle

2. Implement a VRF randomness oracle with the offchain rollup request-response
model using the JavaScript Engine. It should generate cryptographically secure
random numbers.
3. Build a Graph API oracle that accesses SubQuery/SubSquid to get a list of the
accounts and submits to ink! contracts
4. Create a demo of for both the VRF and API oracle (with user specified RPC and
sender)
5. These should be built in the same way as the Lens API oracle, extendible and
customizable
