**Context** (optional)
We have already delivered a pod application with Phat Contracts that performs trusted setup ceremonies for ZK projects. We are now delivering a fully functional web front end application to interact with the decentralized service.

**Deliverables**
> Please provide a list of all deliverables of the milestone extracted from the initial application and a link to the deliverable itself. Ideally all links inside the below table should include a commit hash, which will be used for testing. If you don't provide a commit hash, we will work off the default branch of your repository. Thus, if you plan on continuing work after delivery, we suggest you create a separate branch for either the delivery or your continuing work.
>
> If there is anything particular about any of the deliverables we or a future reader should know, use the respective `Notes` column.

The delivery includes different files and PRs, in order to facilitate the review process, I have linked the relevant files for each milestone.
